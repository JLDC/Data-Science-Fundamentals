    "## Fitting a random forest\n",
    "As with many of the `scikit-learn` models, the [`RandomForestRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor) comes with a lot of hyperparameters. We won't cover them in depth but when you are working with any model for your work or research, it is important that you understand what those hyperparameters do and which one you want to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest estimator is a kind of modified bootstrap aggregating (**bagging**) of decision trees. The important difference between random forests and bagging is that random forests use *de-correlated* trees to improve on bagging. Using de-correlated trees will typically lower the prediction variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how many trees are there in a forest? Well, this is one of the hyperparameters. The default value in `scikit-learn` is 100 but there's no reason that we shouldn't use something else. So we will start by comparing the performance of different forest sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to compare the performance? Cross-validation seems like an intuitive choice. However, due to the time it takes to cross-validate many forests on such a large dataset, we will use the **out-of-bag error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Out-of-bag vs. validation error\n",
    "The typical method of growing a random forest consists in using **bootstrap samples** to build the trees. This implies that, for each tree, some of the training data has not been used for the fit. In consequence, we can use this data as an approximation of how well our tree would perform out-of-sample. The error we compute using this leftover data is named the **out-of-bag error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why would we use the out-of-bag error instead of the validation error? Well, we have the out-of-bag data *already* due to the way we are building each tree. Of course, we could use a validation set, or even cross-validation which would probably be better in terms of accuracy. However, this is much more costly to compute, whereas the out-of-bag error is much faster. In a sense, this is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. If your dataset is not too large and your computing power is enough, you might prefer running cross-validation. Let us start with the out-of-bag error to select our number of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn package only implements the R² (recall the notebook `106_ols-train-test-cv.ipynb`) as the out-of-bag score. However, it also provides a vector of out-of-bag predictions, such that we can use this vector to compute our own metric. This makes things slightly more complicated and we will have to add our own computations of MSE on out-of-bag predictions, but it's nothing we can't deal with!"

    "A **hyperparameter** is a parameter whose value is not learned during training. Instead it is used to control the learning process. We didn't discuss it in detail, but we have already seen a hyperparameter when looking at decision trees; this was the *cost-complexity pruning parameter* $\\alpha$ (`ccp_alpha`). There are a few hyperparameters that can be tuned when using a random forest, typically, you want to look at [the official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) to better understand which hyperparameters are available and how they are implemented in the package you use. Some of the hyperparameters of the random forest implemented in scikit-learn are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `n_estimators`: The numbers of trees used to grow our forest, we have already played a bit with this hyperparameter above.\n",
    "+ `max_features`: The number of features considered at each split. Be sure to look at the documentation, we can use many different inputs for this value, e.g., the number of features as an integer or the fraction of features as a float.\n",
    "+ `min_samples_leaf`: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split will only be considered if there are at least `min_samples_leaf` in each of the resulting branches.\n",
    "+ `ccp_alpha`: The [cost-complexity pruning parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#minimal-cost-complexity-pruning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because hyperparameters are not derived during training, we have to think about how to select the best value of our hyperparameters. While there are [different strategies](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) to do so, **grid search** is the simplest method. If you consider what we did above with the size of the forest, we have already done hyperparameter tuning through grid search, i.e., we have selected the number of trees in the forest by trying out different values and choosing the best on the out-of-bag sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of grid search is that it can take a long time to run, because we are trying many different models. For instance, when considering $10$ different values for `n_estimators`, we have to grow $10$ forests. However, if we now also want to try $5$ values of `max_features`, we need to try $10 \\cdot 5=50$ models. Hence, as we want to tune more hyperparameters, and, as the grid search gets more granular, the number of models we need to estimate increases drastically.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Below, we provide an example of grid search for hyperparameter tuning. Because this can take a lot of time, **do not run it in class!** ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, even at home, this will take very long to run!"
