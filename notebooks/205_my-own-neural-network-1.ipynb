    "# Building our own Neural Network (pt. 1)\n",
    "___\n",
    "In this script we will build our own *home-made* neural network without the help of the `scikit-learn` package's model. We will train our network using **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**, as is customary in neural networks. Backpropagation and gradient descent are closely related, but there is an important difference:  \n",
    "+ **Gradient descent** is the optimization algorithm used to *minimize the loss*.\n",
    "+ **Backpropagation** is the differentiation algorithm used to *compute the gradients*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through this notebook will give you a better understanding of what these fancy graphical representations of neural networks really mean in terms of math and programming. For simplicity, we omit any bias terms, i.e., constant-value features in the input or hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at a classification example with only two input features, a single hidden layer with $n_Z$ hidden nodes, and a single output. The code is flexible with respect to the number of hidden nodes, so you can adjust them to see how the results change with more or less nodes in the hidden layer. When training the network, we will actually use stochastic gradient descent rather than gradient descent. Stochastic gradient descent is a special case of gradient descent. The idea is to compute the gradient using only a random subsample of the data instead of the full dataset. This has three main advantages:\n",
    "1. It is typically quicker to reach a *good* result.\n",
    "2. It is less likely that we end up getting stuck in a local minimum.\n",
    "3. It slightly simplifies the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, neural networks entail a lot of matrix multiplications, so hopefully your linear algebra is up-to-date!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this way of building a neural network is purely pedagogical. There is no chance that you would actually build your own neural network in a practical scenario. You would simply implement a network using one of the many deep learning packages in Python (see the first notebook *Introduction to Python*, for links to some of these packages)."

    "\n",
    "First, we will begin by standardizing the data. **This is an absolute must for neural networks**, even when working with a library instead of your own *home-built* network, standardizing your data is key!\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is it so important to standardize with neural networks as opposed to other statistical models? The answer lies in **gradient descent**. In truth, it's not some neural network specific architecture that makes it so important to standardize but simply the application of gradient descent. To see why, consider the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that we have two features, $\\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\\mathbf{x}_2$, and we are trying to find the weights $w_1$, $w_2$ which minimize the mean squared error $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y^{(i)} - w_1 x_1^{(i)} - w_2 x_2^{(i)})^2$. So just as we did in some previous notebooks. Recall, that the weight updates are then given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "w_1 &\\leftarrow w_1 - \\eta \\frac{\\partial \\text{MSE}}{\\partial w_1} \\\\\n",
    "w_2 &\\leftarrow w_2 - \\eta \\frac{\\partial \\text{MSE}}{\\partial w_2} \n",

    "w_1 &\\leftarrow w_1 - \\eta \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y^{(i)} - w_1 x_1^{(i)} - w_2 x_2^{(i)}) (-x_1^{(i)}) \\\\\n",
    "w_2 &\\leftarrow w_2 - \\eta \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y^{(i)} - w_1 x_1^{(i)} - w_2 x_2^{(i)}) (-x_2^{(i)}).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The important part of this equation is the last one. The updates on the weight $w_1$ are **scaled** by the values of the feature $x_1$, and the same happens for the weights $w_2$ with the features $x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the iris example, where $x_1$ was the sepal width in centimeters, and $x_2$ the sepal length in centimeters. Both values in centimeters are on a somewhat similar scale, so this is not a problem. Consider, however, what would happen if instead we were to use the the sepal width in nanometers? Suddenly, our $x_1$ would be on average around 10 million times larger than the $x_2$ and the weight updates of $w_1$ would completely dominate the learning rate! So in the end, we would be dealing with a learning procedure where either $w_1$ has crazy explosive updates or $w_2$ nearly doesn't move, this would make it very hard for our network to converge!"

Think about it: every data point can be represented on an $(x_1, x_2)$ plane, and, for every data point, we can make a prediction using our neural network. Combining this, we can create a grid of thinly spaced $(x_1, x_2)$ points, feed them to our neural network and plot them according to the output it suggests.\n",

    "The benign tumors are shown in blue above and the malignant ones in orange. The color in the background are the decision regions of our neural network. We notice that the decision boundary is a straight line. The intensity of the color regions show *how sure* the neural network is in making the prediction, i.e. in the dark purple area in the top right, the network assigns a very high probability that the tumor is malignant while in the lower left, the probability is very low. Around the white band however, the probability is around 0.5. Of course, in the end, a tumor is always classified as either benign or malignant, but this helps us visualize where the predictions are more *unstable*."
