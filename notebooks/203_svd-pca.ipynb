Without going to deep into the mathematics, an orthonormal basis is a set of unit vectors (i.e., vectors with length one) that are orthogonal to each other (i.e., their inner product is zero). The simplest orthonormal basis we can think of is defined by the basis vectors $[1, 0]$ and $[0, 1]$, it is also the standard basis in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n",
