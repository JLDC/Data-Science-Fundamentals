    "# Long and Wide Data Formats\n",
    "___\n",
    "In this script, we will talk a little about data formats, in particular the **long** and **wide** formats. While those are not the only formats that exist, they are, without doubt, the most prevalent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you will receive data in a *tabular* format (e.g., like an Excel spreadsheet, with rows and columns), where the data is either in long or wide format. It's important that you are comfortable with both formats and that you are able to transform a dataframe from one format to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, with `pandas`, you will be using **wide format** most of the time. However, when obtaining data from external sources, you will often be faced with data in **long format** as well, hence, it's good to know both. Personally, I also feel like wide format is generally more intuitive, but others might have different views."
