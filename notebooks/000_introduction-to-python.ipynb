    "> I am a firm believer in this mantra. You could simply go through the notebooks and run the code, but you would only learn half as much. Try changing things and adding your custom code. You will run into errors, and that is okay. You will also improve, and in no time, you will become quite good at programming and data science. So do yourself a favor, and try to get your hands dirty as much as possible!\n",

    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "___\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language, meaning it can be used to do a lot of different things. Building websites, creating games, analyzing data, programming AI and machine learning pipelines... you name it. Python does it all! Furthermore, Python is considered one of the easiest programming languages there is to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this flexibility comes with a cost:\n",
    "1. **Python is slow**. Writing a highly efficient program in pure Python is difficult and it will always be outperformed by other languages such as C++, Fortran, Julia, etc. However, this is not a big problem for us. In fact, Python comes with so-called packages (more on them later on), which are mainly written in C++ and Fortran. These packages basically allow us to write code in Python but with Fortran and C++ speed, unifying the best of both worlds. The only caveat, is that we need those packages to be fast, but don't worry! Python is widely adopted and the community is great. There is nearly no chance of you not finding a package for the task you are aiming to accomplish.\n",
    "2. **Python is not tailored for data science or statistics**. While this is not a big problem in itself, sometimes other languages such as R or Julia, which were developed with numerical computation in mind, can be slightly more intuitive when it comes to doing data science. This doesn't mean Python is bad in that regards, quite to the contrary, but, as you will see, we will learn about *Python basics* and then, we will have to change the way we think when dealing with arrays in the numerical computation package `numpy`.\n",

    "You cannot use any variable name you'd like, in general there are two things to look out for:\n",
    "1. There are some name of variables that will throw an error, such as starting your variable name with a number or using special characters like `?.\\+-*/` (`_` is allowed and very often used, e.g. `my_variable = 3`).\n",
    "2. There are reserved names. These are used by Python and cannot (or should not) be overwritten. E.g. `from`, `import`, `if`, `and`, `else`, `True`, `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in programming there are *conventions*, that is, people agree on how the code should be written, it's not enforced but it's **very good practice** to follow these. The problem is that different people and different programming languages have different conventions, so it can get a bit messy. In Python, the most widely used convention is to follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pay close attention, you will see that we do not always strictly follow PEP 8. In practice, the conventions you will use greatly depend on the project you are working on and the team you are working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, try to:\n",
    "+ **Make your variable names expressive but not too long**, e.g., `dataframe_of_bike_rentals` is too long and `d` is not very informative. A good name for your data of bike rentals could be `rentals`.\n",
    "+ **Use snake case**, i.e., separate words with an underscore. `this_is_an_example_of_a_variable_name_with_snake_case`, while `ThisIsAnExampleOfAVariableWithCamelCase`. Both snake and camel case are fine, but in Python, we generally use snake case for variables and use camel case to symbolize objects! You don't know the difference between objects and variables yet, but we won't be creating our own objects, so just stick to snake case, i.e., write everything small unless it's supposed to represent a matrix, then you might want to use somethings like `X` to represent the $\\mathbf{X}$ matrix."

    "For this course, we will be working mainly with 4 packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): The numerical computing package for Python. This introduces arrays in the sense of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, allows us to do linear algebra, fast vector computations, etc. When doing data science in Python, it's good to think of everything as a NumPy array. At first it might seem like we are not using this package as much as the other but this is wrong! This package provides the necessary foundation for all of the three other packages!\n",
    "+ [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): The Python data analysis library. This package provides tool for working with *tabular data* such as dataframes (you might know them from R). This package is our bread-and-butter for data cleaning and pre-processing, all analyis we will do starts by reading our data into a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "+ [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): The visualization package for Python. This package provides tools to build many different plots, either static or interactive. We will use it a lot to illustrate our data and results. As the old adage goes: *a picture is worth a thousand words*. Being able to create beautiful visualizations is an important competence of a data scientist!\n",
    "+ [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): The scientific machine learning package for Python. From linear regression to gradient boosted trees and neural networks... you name it, scikit-learn has it! Not only does this package provide the statistical models, it also provides many functionalities to help us tune and improve our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All those packages are, without doubt, state-of-the-art when it comes to doing data science and machine learning in Python. It should be mentioned, however, that when it comes to deep learning, scikit-learn is often overshadowed by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), or [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For our introduction to neural networks, scikit-learn will be enough, however, it would be dishonest to claim that modern deep learning is being done with scikit-learn. "
